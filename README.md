# Maika [![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/382725233695522816/embed.png)](https://discord.gg/7TtMP2n) [![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/auguwu/Maika.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/auguwu/Maika)
**Customizable, stable Discord bot made in the [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris) library.**

## Installing
> You can't clone Maika since I don't condone of publishing "fake" public bot clones into any bot list since you're just using my code as a base and not editing it.
>
> If you wanna keep Maika as a base, you can but you have to follow some rules:

> -> **1**: `DO NOT ADD YOUR INSTANCE TO ANY PUBLIC BOT LISTS.`

> -> **2**: `Your clone must be credited (even though my license doesn't condone it but I made the source code right?)`

> -> **3**: `Your instance must be privated to friends and not be a public bot.`

> If you don't break any of those guidelines, you should be good of not me going to friend you and ask you to stop and it will become a big pile of mess since it's a silly argument of "cloning" another person's bot without their permission / not crediting them.
>
> If you do credit me, you can credit me in the README.md (if it's a public GitHub repository) or in any "footer" / credits command.
